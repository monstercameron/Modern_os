add quick and subtle animates to the entire project
I like springy and sub 100ms animations
create a standardized way to handle errors and log out only relevant errors
the quick settings area in the taskbara should be clickable with toggles check boxes for relevant controls
on click it shoud take over the entire working area and show a gaussian blurred background so the notificaitons and quick ettings can be highlighted
create a pub/sub system for apps to tap into for them to comm with each other, ex the music player controls should show up in the notif area and they interact via events
create a task manager that simlate our mock de, it should be able to kill running apps

simulat eteh same strat for for the taskbar, use pub/sub to connect from taskbar to window controls

next add window resizing
